## `acfoutline2json`

Usage: `acfoutline2json <filename.acf>`

Reads `acf_outline_t` information using BetterPushback's `acf_outline.c` and dumps all data as JSON to stdout.

Needs to be compiled against `../src` and `libacfutils`.

## `plot_outline.py`

Usage: `plot_outline.py <dump.json> <output path> <scale factor>`

Reads a JSON file as generated by `acfoutline2json` and plots fuselage and wing coordinates multiplied by the given scale factor to the specified output filename. All coordinates will be mirrored on the X axis to form a normal aircraft shape.

Surfaces are colored according to their function as identified by `acf_outline.c`:

- fuselage is black
- main wings are blue
- stabilizer wings are red

The script requires Python 3 and Pillow/PIL.
